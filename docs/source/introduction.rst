Introduction

That Metric Timeline (TMT) is a Python library aimed at the machine/deep learning practitioner/researcher. This library aims to: 

  - Help the user keeping track of experiments, their metrics, their results and the code used to produce them; 
  - Provide an easy-to-use and `KISS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_ based library to the user; 
  - Do the bare-minimum (i.e., no fancy web interfaces, plotting and so on), but do it (hopefully) right; 
  - Give an open-source experiment tracking library to the community which is free both as in "free beer" and "free speech".  
  
So many times when working on a research project I've seen the number of experiments skyrocketing in the blink of an eye...and then when we come back to our project after "some time off", we may have lost track of where the results are, what was the code that produced them and so on.  
This library can hopefully be a solution to all of this :)


Have a look at the :doc:`quickstart` section of this documentation to start using ``tmt``. The library is hosted as an open-source 
project (with GPL-3) on `Github <https://github.com/levnikmyskin/that_metric_timeline>`_.
