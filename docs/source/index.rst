Welcome to ThatMetricTimeline's documentation!
==============================================

That Metric Timeline (TMT) is a Python library aimed at the machine/deep learning practitioner/researcher. It helps tracking 
experiments, saving code, metrics and results. This is done in the simplest way possible, both from the user and the library 
developer perspective: ``tmt`` follows the `KISS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_ principle.

Finally, this library works 100% offline, you don't need the internet, a cloud subscription nor anything else: an old-fashioned library.
