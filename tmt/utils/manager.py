class TmtManager:
    """
    This is a rather minimalistic helper class which you can use to load experiments, load pickled results, see metrics and so on.
    The recommended way of looking for an experiment is using `tmt` terminal user interface (see :ref:`TMT TUI <tmttui>`).
    Once you have a unique id or name, you can use one of the setter methods to set the :py:class:`tmt.storage.schema.Entry` (i.e., an experiment) to be 
    used with this instance. If you want low-level access to the json database (read-only operations), you can access the `db` member.

    **Usage**:

    .. code-block:: python

        from tmt import TmtManager

        # Let's say we know there is an experiment with id "example"


        # An Entry is a row in the database, i.e. an experiment that was tracked.
        manager = TmtManager()
        manager.set_entry_by_id('example') 

        # load the results and unpickle them
        for name, path in manager.results_paths():
            with open(path, 'rb') as f:
                # do stuff with your results. If it's a pickle it's 
                # more convenient to use the code block below this one
                res = pickle.load(f)

        # load the unpickled results
        for name, res in manager.load_results():
            # do something with your results.
            # if res is a numpy array...
            print(res.mean())


        for name, val in manager.get_metrics():
            print(f"{name}: {val}")

        # If you need to do other stuff, like searching for 
        # experiments between two datetimes and so on
        # you can access the `db` member like
        manager.db.get_entries_greater_than_date(date_or_timestamp)
